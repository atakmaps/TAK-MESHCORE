# UV-PRO — Open-Source BTECH Radio ↔ ATAK Bridge Plugin

A free, open-source ATAK plugin that connects UV-PRO radios to the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) over Bluetooth. Team members with radios can share positions, chat, and situational awareness data entirely off-grid — no cell service or internet required.

## Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Position Sharing (PLI)** | ✅ Working | Your ATAK position is beaconed over radio at a configurable interval. Incoming positions appear as contacts on the map. |
| **Smart Beaconing (APRS-style)** | ✅ Working | APRS-standard SmartBeaconing + corner pegging: speed-proportional rate, turn-threshold slope, and minimum turn time. Seven parameters configurable in Settings → Manage Smart Beacon Settings. |
| **Dynamic CoT Stale Window** | ✅ Working | Contact `stale` timestamp now tracks current beacon policy (fixed interval or Smart Beacon profile) so receivers do not grey contacts prematurely. |
| **Ping / Ping Reply** | ✅ Working | **Send Ping** broadcasts a discovery ping; **Send Ping Reply** (Settings) auto-replies to incoming pings with your GPS position. Replies use **slotted timing** (default 20 slots × 2.5 s) keyed by callsign hash to reduce collisions. |
| **Net slot administration** | ✅ Working | Team leadership can set slot count/time and **Distribute to net** (`TYPE_NET_SLOT_CONFIG`); receivers auto-apply newer assignments. In **Settings → Tool Preferences → UV-PRO Settings → Administration** or **Plugin Settings** (bottom of dialog). |
| **Bluetooth Scan & Connect** | ✅ Working | Instant picker showing previously-connected radios with live green/gray availability dots. Auto-connects to last used radio on ATAK startup. |
| **Radio Connection Status Overlay** | ✅ Working | Persistent BTECH icon in the lower-right map corner (green = connected, desaturated = disconnected). **Tap the icon** to open the UV-PRO panel (same as Menu → Tools → UV-PRO). |
| **GeoChat over RF (contact-centric)** | ✅ Working | Chat to radio peers using ATAK's native Contacts/GeoChat UI (plugin contacts route via RF transport). |
| **GeoChat delivery receipts (checkmarks)** | ✅ Working | ATAK's native single-checkmark (delivered) and double-checkmark (read) appear on the sender's chat window. |
| **Retry on no ACK + delivery failure alert** | ✅ Working | If no delivered ACK within the configured interval, message is retransmitted up to max retries. If all retries exhausted, a persistent alert appears. Retry interval and max retries adjustable in Settings. |
| **Contact-targeted CoT over RF** | ✅ Working | Any CoT item sendable to a contact in ATAK — waypoints, routes, casevac/9-line, drawings, markers — is intercepted, compressed, and relayed over RF. |
| **SA Relay (opt-in)** | ✅ Working | Network-to-radio bridge: broadcasts received SA over RF to radio-only users. Configurable in Settings. |
| **AES-256 Encryption** | ✅ Working | Optional shared-secret AES-256-GCM for all radio traffic. All nodes must use the same secret. |
| **Contact Tracking** | ✅ Working | Radios in range tracked as contacts with callsign, last-seen time, and position. |
| **Map Repeater Load/Tune (KML)** | ✅ Working | Tap a repeater placemark from imported KML, arm **Load Selected Repeater**, then tap a destination channel to program/tune it (TX/RX + CTCSS/DCS). |
| **TX Power (LOW / MED / HIGH)** | ✅ Working | **TX Power** button in the Radio panel (left of Dual Watch) cycles transmit power and writes both device settings and per-channel RF memory (digital/APRS + active VFO channels). Syncs from the radio on connect. |
| **APRS TX mode (plugin-generated over KISS)** | ✅ Working | Optional APRS beacon TX runs in parallel with UV-PRO traffic. Requires FCC call + icon in settings, supports manual **Send APRS Beacon**, and can temporarily disable ATAK position beacons when desired. APRS chat requests ACK on the first message to a contact and auto-ACKs inbound APRS messages that request acknowledgment. |
| **Channel grid refresh** | ✅ Working | After long-press manual channel edit/save, the channel grid re-reads that slot from the radio so labels/frequencies match what was programmed. |
| **Bluetooth Auto-Reconnect** | ✅ Working | Three-strategy SPP connection with exponential backoff reconnect (up to 5 attempts). |
| **Radio Silence (TX Kill Switch)** | ✅ Working | Long-press control in the Radio panel that blocks all outbound TX while still receiving beacons/pings/chat/CoT. Long-press again to restore TX. |
| **RF -> TAK Uplink Relay** | ✅ Working | Optional uplink path: forward inbound RF CoT/chat from radio-only users to TAK network when SA Relay + uplink toggle are enabled. |

```

The plugin talks to the radio over Bluetooth SPP using the KISS TNC protocol. Data is encapsulated in AX.25 frames with a compact binary format. On the ATAK side, incoming packets become CoT events, map contacts, and chat messages; outgoing ATAK data is serialized, optionally encrypted, and transmitted over radio.

## Requirements

### To Use the Plugin
- **ATAK-CIV 5.5.1** (or compatible version) installed on your Android device
- **UV-PRO** radio (UV-PRO, GMRS-PRO, or UV-50X series with KISS TNC support)
- **Bluetooth** pairing between the Android device and radio

### To Build from Source
- **JDK 17** — [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) recommended. Other JDK 17 distributions work too.
- **Android SDK** with API level 35 — install via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or the [command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only)
- **ATAK-CIV 5.5.1 SDK** — available from the [atak-civ GitHub repo](https://github.com/TAK-Product-Center/atak-civ)
- **Git** — to clone the repo

> **Note:** You do _not_ need to install Gradle. The included Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`) downloads the correct version automatically.

## Quick Install (Pre-built APK)

If you just want to install the plugin without building it:

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Transfer it to your Android device.
3. Install with: `adb install -r UVPro-*.apk`
4. Open ATAK → Menu → Tools → **UV-PRO**.

APK filenames look like `ATAK-Plugin-UVPro-*-civ-release.apk` (or `civ-debug` for debug builds).

### Upgrading from a debug or self-signed build

If you previously installed a **debug** or **self-signed** (non-TPC) build, Android will block the upgrade with an "App not installed" or "incompatible" error because the signing certificate changed. This is a one-time issue — all TPC-signed releases share the same certificate going forward.

**Fix (your ATAK data is safe):**

> Uninstalling the plugin APK does **not** affect the `/atak` directory, your maps, contacts, tracks, or any other ATAK data. That data belongs to the ATAK application, not this plugin.

```bash
# 1. Remove the old plugin (ATAK data is untouched)
adb uninstall com.uvpro.plugin

# 2. Install the new TPC-signed APK
adb install ATAK-Plugin-UVPro-*-tpc-*-civ-release.apk
```

After reinstalling, open ATAK → Menu → Tools → **UV-PRO** and reconnect your radio. All previous settings are stored in ATAK's shared preferences and will be restored automatically.

## GitHub releases and signing

- **Third-party (TPC) signing:** The APK that is fully aligned with **stock ATAK-CIV** and the usual install rules is the one built and signed on the **TAK Product Center third-party pipeline** (takrepo). It may show the standard indicator that the plugin was signed with the third-party service. No extra code is required in this repo for that — trust comes from the **pipeline signature**, not a flag in Java.
- **GitHub Releases:** Each [release](https://github.com/atakmaps/UV-PRO/releases) can attach the **same civ-release APK** produced for that version (ideally the TPC output). You can also build `assembleCivRelease` yourself (see below); for **public distribution**, prefer the **TPC-signed** binary when you have it.
- **Local `assembleCivRelease`:** ProGuard/R8 needs an **ATAK apply-mapping** file. This repo sets `atak.proguard.mapping` automatically: if you place the real `proguard-civ-release-mapping.txt` from a TPC/takrepo build in `app/libs/atak-civ/`, that is used; otherwise a **placeholder empty mapping** (`tools/empty-atak-applymapping.txt`) is used so the build completes. A build with the placeholder is fine for **CI smoke tests**; for **field use**, prefer a release built with the **official ATAK mapping** and/or the **TPC APK**.
- The `android` block in `app/build.gradle` sets `bundle { storeArchive { enable = false } }` as required by **atak-takdev** `takdevLint` for release signing.

## Building from Source

### 1. Download the ATAK-CIV SDK

Go to the [atak-civ GitHub repo](https://github.com/TAK-Product-Center/atak-civ), download the **ATAK-CIV 5.5.1 SDK**, and extract these files into `app/libs/atak-civ/`:

```
app/libs/atak-civ/
├── main.jar
├── atak-gradle-takdev.jar
├── android_keystore
└── proguard-release-keep.txt
```

> The SDK zip contains more files — you only need these four.

### 2. Configure `gradle.properties`

The repository includes a committed `gradle.properties` with shared flags. If Gradle does not pick up **JDK 17** automatically, add a line to that file (or copy from the template and merge):

```bash
# optional if JAVA_HOME is not JDK 17:
# cp gradle.properties.example gradle.properties   # only if you need a fresh file
```

Open `gradle.properties` and set `org.gradle.java.home` to your JDK 17 if needed:

| OS | Typical JDK 17 Path |
|----|---------------------|
| **Windows** | `C:\\Program Files\\Eclipse Adoptium\\jdk-17.x.x-hotspot` |
| **macOS** | `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home` |
| **Linux** | `/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-17-jdk-amd64` |

> **Tip:** If your system `JAVA_HOME` already points to JDK 17, you can delete the `org.gradle.java.home` line entirely.

### 3. Build the APK

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/atakmaps/UV-PRO.git
cd UV-PRO

# Linux/macOS
./gradlew assembleCivDebug

# Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)
gradlew.bat assembleCivDebug
```

The APK will be at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/civ/debug/ATAK-Plugin-UVPro-*.apk
```

### 4. Install

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/civ/debug/ATAK-Plugin-UVPro-*.apk
```

Then open ATAK → Menu → Tools → **UV-PRO**.

### 5. Release (minified) build — `assembleCivRelease`

For a **R8/ProGuard** release build (smaller, obfuscated) matching the TPC `civRelease` variant:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleCivRelease
# Windows: gradlew.bat :app:assembleCivRelease
```

Output:

```
app/build/outputs/apk/civ/release/ATAK-Plugin-UVPro-*-civ-release.apk
```

Use the **official ProGuard apply-mapping** from the ATAK/takrepo pipeline when you need a **production-equivalent** binary (see [GitHub releases and signing](#github-releases-and-signing) above).

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Android Gradle plugin requires Java 17` | Your `gradle.properties` is missing or `org.gradle.java.home` points to the wrong JDK. See step 2. |
| `Could not find main.jar` | The ATAK SDK files aren't in `app/libs/atak-civ/`. See step 1. |
| `AAPT: error: resource not found` | Run `./gradlew clean` and rebuild. |
| Build succeeds but plugin doesn't appear in ATAK | Make sure you're running **ATAK-CIV 5.5.1** — the plugin is compiled against this specific version. |

## Usage

1. **Pair your radio** with your Android device via Bluetooth settings.
2. Open the **UV-PRO** plugin in ATAK.
3. Tap **Scan** to find your radio, then tap it to connect.
4. The status dot turns green when connected.

### Plugin Controls

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **AES-256-GCM switch** | Enable encryption (enter the shared secret first) |
| **Send Beacon** | Immediately broadcast your current ATAK/UV-PRO position beacon |
| **Send Ping** | Broadcast a discovery ping to radios in range |
| **Long Press for APRS Beacon** | Enable/disable scheduled APRS beacons (follows ATAK beacon interval policy while enabled) |
| **Send APRS Beacon** | Manually transmit one APRS position beacon now |
| **Long Press for Radio Silence** | Toggle TX block on/off (RX remains active). Active state is highlighted with an orange border. |
| **Load Selected Repeater** | Arms repeater load mode (yellow border + `Select Channel` label), then writes/tunes selected repeater to the tapped channel |
| **TX Power** | Tap to cycle **LOW → MED → HIGH**; updates global VFO settings and channel power flags on the digital/APRS channel plus active VFO slots |
| **Plugin Settings** | APRS (FCC call, SSID, icon grid picker, message), Beacon, ping reply, SA Relay, encryption, retries, and **Administration** (slot count/time, distribute to net). Full list also under ATAK **Settings → Tool Preferences → UV-PRO Settings**. |

### Repeater workflow (KML)

1. Import repeater KML into ATAK.
2. Tap a repeater placemark on the map (must contain TX/RX and tone metadata).
3. UV-PRO opens and updates **Selected Repeater**.
4. Tap **Load Selected Repeater** (button arms and turns yellow with `Select Channel` text).
5. Tap destination channel in **Channel Control** grid to program/tune that channel.

### Contact-centric routing (important)

Radio peers are represented as **native ATAK Contacts** (UIDs look like `ANDROID-<CALLSIGN>`). Use the ATAK Contacts UI to:

- open GeoChat with a radio contact (messages route over RF via the plugin).

Waypoints, routes, casevac/9-line, drawings, and other CoT items can all be sent to a radio contact using the native ATAK "Send to Contact" UI. The plugin intercepts the outbound CoT, compresses it, fragments it if needed, and transmits it over RF.

### SA Relay

Enable **SA Relay** in Settings to automatically broadcast received network SA (team positions, waypoints, routes) over RF to all radio users on frequency. This is designed for a single designated relay node — **do not enable unless instructed by your team leader.** A per-contact 30-second throttle prevents channel flooding.

For deeper implementation details and a full “new agent” handoff (logic trees, key files, known ATAK gotchas), see `HANDOFF.md`.

### Encryption

When enabled, all outgoing packets are encrypted with AES-256-CBC using a key derived from your passphrase (PBKDF2). **All radios in your group must use the same passphrase.** If a packet fails to decrypt on the receiving end, it is silently dropped.
